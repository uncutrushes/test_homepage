This gave me ample opportunity to study plants and wildlife in their natural habitats. <a href="illustration_3.html#index8" target="blank">‘Neptune’s Future’</a> presented by <a href="https://www.katehumble.com/" target="Kate Humble website">Kate Humble</a>, was made again in collaboration with 196 and the <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/appeal/fifty-years-of-neptune-coastline-campaign" target="Fifty years of Neptune Coastline campaign website">National Trust</a>.  It tells the story of how the Trust is looking after over 600 miles of coast and the wildlife that thrives under its protection.  The wildlife we encountered while filming was very special and included a short-eared owl, the endangered red squirrels, the Glanville fritillary butterfly and the arctic terns.  Showing conservation in action, it reveals how we can combat the effects of climate change, regenerate rare natural habitats and allow species migration through the sensitive management of our land.

                        <p class="lead">I love painting plants. I find drawing trees in graphite therapeutic and leaf painting in autumn is great fun. The disciplines of botanic art have proved a good grounding for illustrating all forms of nature. Recently I have been studying and painting birds using my botanic painting techniques. The kind provision of photographs from Cardiff based photographer John Lewis and my husband Bruce Rawlings, has helped immensely. I really enjoy capturing these charmers.
