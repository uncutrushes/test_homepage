                        <br>
                        <p class="lead">The National Trust has used 196 Productions to produce programmes such as ‘Neptune’s Future’ presented by Kate Humble. This programme was made up of material filmed all over the UK by 196's camera crews and incorporated archive material from many National Trust sources.<br><br>As the Trust is responsible for several hundred miles of Britain’s coastline, the video was commissioned not only to celebrate its beauty and bio-diversity but to highlight the challenges that climate change will bring to the Trust over the coming years. This meant that the documentary had to explain not only processes like Coastal Squeeze, but what impact these processes will have on tenants and residents living near to the coastline over the next ten and twenty years. Examples of these environmental processes had to be filmed as well as some of the initiatives the Trust was employing to combat the problem. The National Trust’s branding had to be honoured at all times, which was not only enforced through the DVD cover and title graphics, but also by the clothing of the specialists being interviewed.<br><br>With over 40 sites to be filmed, located throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland, within a three month period, this was a demanding but rewarding project to work on. The material was reversioned for TV news releases and political briefing videos.

                        <p class="lead">GLIMPSE is a 5-year glaciology research project based at the Department of Geography, Swansea University in South Wales (U.K.). Through the use of international collaborative research, fieldwork, remote sensing and modelling techniques, its objectives are to gain an understanding of how Greenland’s melting ice sheet is impacting on the Earth.
                            <br><br>196 Productions’ cameraman Mark Thorne trained PHD Student Lawrence Dyke to use a video camera and bring back pictures of the field research being undertaken on Greenland’s glacial ice sheet. The pictures Lawrence produced were edited by 196 to tell the story of GLIMPSE’s work, its findings, and their importance in order to combat the decline of Greenland’s Glaciers.
